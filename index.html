        <div class="game">
            <h2>Minecraft</h2>
            <p>I love exploring the vast worlds of Minecraft, building incredible structures and surviving in harsh environments. My favorite activity is going to the Ender World to defeat the Ender Dragon.</p>
            <p>I play Minecraft since 2011, when I've downloaded the lite version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition on my iPad (which was broken a few years later). Then in a few month I've got a CD disk of illegally copied minecraft for a laptop, where I tried to play Minecraft</p>
            <p>In 2014 I was playing Minecraft 1.5.2 a lot. I had some mod pack there, but I noticed that everything was lagging, and so I deleted mods, and the lags disappeared. I was playing single player game, but my imagination was really high.</p>
            <p>Since 2018 I started playing Minecraft online, and then in 2023 I finally bought myself the Minecraft license. That was my dream to buy Minecraft one day and I did it!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h2>Brawl Stars</h2>
            <p>Brawl Stars is one of my favorite mobile games. I love competing with other players in various modes, leveling up my brawlers and unlocking new skins for free. My favorite brawlers are Shelly, Colt, El Primo, Darryl, Ricochet, Gale, Belle, Mico, and Crow!</p>
            <p>The first time I started playing Brawl Stars was 2018. I could start playing earlier, but when I saw an ad that Supercell made a new game, I thought it was a scam.</p>
            <p>I was deleting and downloading back this game a lot of times. And the funniest thing was that by the time when they had offer to get 49 Megaboxes for 49 gems, I did not have the game installed on my phone.</p>
            <p>Novadays I'm trying to reach the 25th rank as different brawlers.</p>

        <div class="game">
            <h2>Hatsune Miku: Project Diva</h2>
            <p>I love rhythm games, and Hatsune Miku: Project Diva is one of the best. I enjoy music by performing complex combinations and striving for perfect results in each track.</p>
            <p>The first time I've played this game series was in the spring of 2019, i had my PSP, for which were made 3 games: Project Diva (first), Project Diva Second, and Project Diva Extend. I was playing there till 2023, till my PSP got a battery issue and im looking forward to replace the battery one day.</p>
            <p>This year (2024) I've bought myself Hatsune Miku: Project Diva MegaMix with the DLC for the discount on Steam, and later I bought a Dualshock 4, so I can play different games on my PC using a controller. Now I can clear some of the 7 star songs or even 8 star songs on the Extreme difficulty. I'm trying to get better at Project Diva.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h2>CS:GO (CS2)</h2>
            <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (now Counter-Strike 2) is a game where I can get my tactical skills and reactions. I prefer to play in a team and always try my best to improve my skills to reach new heights.</p>
            <p>I dont have much experience in this game, but sometimes I get extremely lucky to win some rounds by myself. I dont play it every single day, but this game seems fun to play with your friends together, as one team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h2>Skyrim</h2>
            <p>In the world of Skyrim, I feel like a real hero. Exploring a huge world, completing quests and leveling up my character is what brings me great pleasure.</p>
            <p>I was playing Skyrim a lot on my cousins' Xbox 360 since elementary school. And later, in a few years, I was able to play Skyrin on my old laptop, which was laggy. But today im ablr to play Skyrim in 60 FPS! I'm trying to get all the achievements on Steam.</p>
